You can mix `jit` and `grad` and any other JAX transformation however you like.

Using `jit` puts constraints on the kind of Python control flow
the function can use; see
the [Gotchas
Notebook](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#python-control-flow-+-JIT)
for more.

### Auto-vectorization with `vmap`

[`vmap`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.html#vectorization-vmap) is
the vectorizing map.
It has the familiar semantics of mapping a function along array axes, but
instead of keeping the loop on the outside, it pushes the loop down into a
functionâ€™s primitive operations for better performance.

Using `vmap` can save you from having to carry around batch dimensions in your
code. For example, consider this simple *unbatched* neural network prediction
function:

```python
def predict(params, input_vec):
  assert input_vec.ndim == 1
   primitives](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax.lax.html#control-flow-operators)
   like
   [`lax.scan`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.scan.html#jax.lax.scan),
   or just use `jit` on smaller subfunctions.
  ```
